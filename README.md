# Project Title: Classic Snake Game
## Author: Wesley Agbongiasede

### Brief Project Description:
The Classic Snake Game is a modern remake of the traditional snake game where players navigate a snake to eat items while avoiding self-collision and wall collisions. With each item consumed, the snake grows longer and the game speeds up, making navigation increasingly difficult. This game is developed using JavaFX, providing a user-friendly interface and smooth gameplay experience.
