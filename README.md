# Project Title: Classic Snake Game
## Author: Wesley Agbongiasede

### Brief Project Description
Classic Snake Game is a nostalgic re-creation of the famous mobile game that peaked in popularity during the early 2000s. This version is built using JavaFX, allowing it to run on any machine with a Java Runtime Environment. The player controls a growing snake, guiding it to eat food while avoiding obstacles and the edges of the game area.

### How to Install and Run the Project
1. Ensure Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and JavaFX SDK are installed on your machine.
2. Download the `.jar` file from the releases section of this repository.
3. Run the game using the command: `java -jar ClassicSnakeGame.jar` in your terminal.

### How to Use the Project (i.e., How to Play the Game)
- Use the arrow keys (↑, ↓, ←, →) to change the direction of the snake.
- Guide the snake to the food items that appear randomly on the screen.
- Each food item consumed will increase the score and the length of the snake.
- Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.
- The game ends when the snake hits a wall or itself.
- Try to score as high as possible before the game over!
